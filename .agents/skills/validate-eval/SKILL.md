description: Validate that a NEW eval is correct and runnable by running it and iterating in a loop until green — fixing infra/config/task bugs (not the model's score), with opt-in hands-off and unlimited/self-healing modes; invoke when authoring or vetting a task before setting `validated: true`.

# Validate a new eval

Prove a newly authored eval is **correct and runnable**, iterating until it runs
clean. The loop fixes the *eval*, not the model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The goal is task correctness, not making the model pass.** A successful
> validation means: the infra provisions, the agent runs end to end, and the
> verification/judge produce **sane scores**. A genuine **model miss** — a clean
> trajectory that just scores low on a hard task — is a *successful* validation,
> not a failure to fix. Do not edit the task to make a weak model pass.
>
> **But first rule out a silent capture failure, which masquerades as a low
> score.** Before reading a low score as a model miss, assert the run's
> `trajectory` is **non-empty** (and `tools` populated for tool-using tasks). An
> empty trajectory on a task the agent clearly acted on is **INVALID** — a harness
> capture failure (e.g. `oc sessions` exiting 127 because Node isn't on PATH), not
> a model miss — and must be fixed and re-run, not recorded. See the empty-traj /
> `exit 127` row in [`known_issues.md`](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md).

This skill is pointer-driven. The run mechanics, monitoring, and self-healing
loop all live in shared references — read them, don't restate them:

- Local vs bastion, auth, clean pre-flight, launch, knobs, results →
  [`../../references/running-evals.md`](../../references/running-evals.md)
- Monitoring / keepalive / recovery →
  [`../../references/monitoring-and-recovery.md`](../../references/monitoring-and-recovery.md)
- Unlimited / self-healing loop →
  [`../../references/unlimited-mode.md`](../../references/unlimited-mode.md)
- Failure router →
  [`../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md`](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md)
- Reading scores →
  [`../../../docs/components/metrics.md`](../../../docs/components/metrics.md)
- Capability → tool mapping →
  [`../../references/harness-capabilities.md`](../../references/harness-capabilities.md)

## Modes (opt-in)

| Mode | When | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | default | You drive the loop directly, one attempt at a time. |
| **Hands-off** | "watch it", "don't stop", long runs | Resilient monitoring + keepalive — [monitoring-and-recovery.md](../../references/monitoring-and-recovery.md). |
| **Unlimited / self-healing** | "keep going until green", "auto-fix and restart" | Diagnose → fix in a worktree → re-sync → restart, capped — [unlimited-mode.md](../../references/unlimited-mode.md). |

Resolve the mode up front; hands-off and unlimited are **explicit opt-in**.

## Flow

### 1. Pre-flight the task spec (optional but recommended)

Before spending a cluster, run the [`task-review`](../task-review/SKILL.md) skill
(or skim the stack/scripts) to catch obvious authoring bugs statically — schema
errors, a non-unique `task_id`, self-collisions (a fixed `$HOME` repo it
`rm -rf`s, a shared-VM-SA role it grants then revokes), or a mis-scoped rubric.
Cheaper to fix on paper than after a 30-min run.

### 2. Run it

Use the mechanics in [running-evals.md](../../references/running-evals.md): choose
local vs bastion + auth, **clean pre-flight** (the "Before any retry" checklist in
[known_issues.md](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md)), `DRY_RUN=1` preview,
then launch the one combo detached and capture `RESUME_STAMP`. Validation is a
single combo per attempt — don't fan out.

### 3. Loop until green

Monitor per [monitoring-and-recovery.md](../../references/monitoring-and-recovery.md).
On each finished or flaked attempt, **classify the failure against the router** in
[known_issues.md](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md) and take exactly one
action (the same decision tree as
[unlimited-mode.md](../../references/unlimited-mode.md)):

- **Retry** — infra flake (Vertex `429`, ssh `exit 255`, transient quota): clean
  per the checklist, re-run. No edit.
- **Fix + retry** — config / auth / host setup (missing API enablement, Vertex
  ADC marker, inotify limit, folder-trust): apply the router's documented fix,
  then retry. Environment fix, not eval-logic.
- **Fix the task + retry** — a real **task/stack/rubric bug** the validation
  surfaced (the thing you're here to catch): fix it in an **isolated worktree**
  scoped to that bug, then retry. Log the cycle in durable state.
- **Escalate / accept** — a genuine **model-capability low score** (clean
  trajectory, hard task): this is a *successful validation*. Record it and stop;
  do **not** edit the task to inflate the score.

Honor the **STOP conditions** from
[unlimited-mode.md](../../references/unlimited-mode.md): goal met, attempt cap
(≤2–3 per attempt), no-progress (same failure signature twice), or budget
exhausted (each restart costs a cluster + ~25–40 min). Hands-off and unlimited
behaviors are opt-in; without them, surface a persistent failure rather than
looping.

### 4. Confirm green + recommend `validated: true`

When the eval runs clean, read the scores
([metrics.md](../../../docs/components/metrics.md)) and confirm they look
**sensible** — checks pass/fail for the right reasons, no swallowed scoring error,
no empty `tokens: {}` masking a timeout. Then recommend setting `validated: true`
on the task (the flag gates leaderboard promotion). If a real model miss is the
only "failure," say so explicitly — the task is validated.

## Living known-issues

When you hit a failure mode **not** already in
[known_issues.md](../../../docs/appendix/known_issues.md), append a router row so
the next run benefits: **symptom → root cause → fix → class**. Keep it terse,
don't duplicate an existing row, and follow the docs conventions (scope +
user-guide, GFM, not journal-like, no model scores). This capture step is part of
validation, not optional.

---

## Guardrails

- **Validate the task, not the model.** Never edit a task to make a weak model
  pass — a genuine miss is a valid result.
- Each attempt costs a real GKE cluster + ~25–40 min — `DRY_RUN=1` first, cap
  attempts (≤2–3), and track budget.
- Make all fixes in an **isolated worktree/branch**; keep commits scoped and
  local — surface the diff for review, don't push shared branches unless asked.
- Never print or commit API keys; redact secrets in summaries.
- Always confirm clean teardown — orphaned `gke-nodes-*` SAs silently `409` the
  next run.
- **Hands-off run:** never emit a completion signal until the eval is terminal
  **and** summarized; emit a periodic heartbeat instead.
- Don't auto-fix what you can't both name and resolve — task-authoring / rubric
  judgement calls escalate to a human.
