Usage: run.sh <task.yaml-path> [gemini|oc] [--no-infra|--infra] [--keep] [--no-seed]

  <task.yaml-path>  Path to a task.yaml, absolute or relative to the repo root.
  gemini|oc         Agent to run (default: gemini).
  --no-infra        Skip infra provisioning; reuse the ambient cluster (default).
  --infra           Provision infra via tofu (required for tofu-seeded tasks).
  --keep            Do not delete the scratch workspace on exit.
  --no-seed         Skip the cleanup, seed, and preflight hooks entirely; run
                    against whatever state is already on the cluster,
                    unchecked. Use this when you deliberately want to test
                    against custom or partially-modified cluster state rather
                    than the canonical fixture.
