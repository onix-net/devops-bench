"""Result sink: write the per-run ``results.json`` and collect artifacts.

The harness depends on a :class:`ResultReporter` rather than calling
:func:`json.dump` inline, so output sinks (DB, dashboard, blob store) can be
added by substituting the reporter without editing the orchestrator.

    ``MetricScore.to_entry()`` / ``AgentResult.to_dict()`` /
    ``ChaosResult.model_dump()`` / ``VerificationResult.model_dump()`` by the
    orchestrator, so the reporter itself only knows how to JSON-encode the
    final dicts.

        results_root: Root directory under which per-run subdirectories are
            created. Defaults to ``"results"``.
        run_dir_prefix: Prefix for the timestamped subdirectory name.
        run_id: Optional run identifier appended to the run-dir name. The
            timestamp alone has 1-second resolution, so two processes started
            in the same second would otherwise collide on one directory;
            appending the (process-unique) run id keeps concurrent runs apart.

    Attributes:
        last_run_dir: The most recent directory returned by
            :meth:`new_run_dir`, or ``None`` if none has been created yet.
