"""Deadline-based dispatcher that evaluates a verification specification.

The whole verification races a single monotonic deadline computed once at the
top of :meth:`VerifierAgent.wait_for_condition`. Sequence nodes consume the
deadline serially and fail fast (later children are recorded as skipped);
parallel nodes hand each child the full remaining deadline and AND the results.
Leaves consume the deadline directly via ``leaf.verify(remaining)``.

Mode dispatch is additive over this existing machinery: three of the four modes
(``converge``, ``assert``, ``hold``) are simply different ways to call the
existing ``verify()`` contract. ``unchanged`` is designed but not built; it
requires a pre-agent snapshot protocol that is not in this PR.
