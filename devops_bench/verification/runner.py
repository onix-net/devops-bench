"""Deadline-based dispatcher that evaluates a verification specification.

The whole verification races a single monotonic deadline computed once at the
top of :meth:`VerifierAgent.wait_for_condition`. Sequence nodes consume the
deadline serially and fail fast (later children are recorded as skipped);
parallel nodes hand each child the full remaining deadline and AND the results.
Leaves consume the deadline directly via ``leaf.verify(remaining)``.
