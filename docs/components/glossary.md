# Glossary and Directory Structure

A plain-language reference to the vocabulary used throughout devops-bench, plus an annotated map of the repository so you can find where each idea lives in code.

## Part A — Glossary

Every term below names a real concept in the codebase. The "Where it lives" column points you at the package or module that owns it.

### Core components

| Term | What it is | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Harness / EvalHarness** | The top-level engine that threads every component together and runs one task end to end (provision, run the agent, inject chaos, verify, score, tear down). The concrete implementation is `DefaultEvalHarness`. | `devops_bench/evalharness/` (`DefaultEvalHarness` in `default.py`) |
| **AgentHarness** | The wrapper around the *agent under test* — the thing being benchmarked. A base class plus an `AGENTS` registry of concrete agents (the Gemini CLI, Openclaw, and in-process API agents). | `devops_bench/agents/` |
| **Model / LLM provider** | The model-agnostic LLM client layer (`gemini`, `claude`, `ollama`), looked up through the `MODELS` registry and constructed by `get_model()`. A *model provider* serves the LLM; do not confuse it with a *cloud provider* (below). | `devops_bench/models/` |
| **Cloud provider** | Credentials plus Terraform variable resolution for a single cloud (`gcp`, `kind`), looked up through the `PROVIDERS` registry. | `devops_bench/providers/` |
| **Deployer** | Provisions and tears down the cluster the agent works against. `TFDeployer` drives OpenTofu; `NoOpDeployer` does nothing (for tasks that run against a pre-existing cluster). | `devops_bench/deployers/` |
| **Task** | The typed eval contract, authored as a `task.yaml`. The schema is code; the tasks themselves live on disk. | Schema in `devops_bench/tasks/schema.py`; tasks under `tasks/` |
| **Metric** | LLM-as-judge plus deterministic scoring, looked up through the `METRICS` registry. | `devops_bench/metrics/` |
| **Outcome validity** | The primary rubric: did the agent actually achieve the goal by *any* valid path? It grades the result, not whether a specific method was followed. | `devops_bench/metrics/outcome_validity.py` |
| **`expected_output` (rubric)** | The per-task grading reference — prose "critical requirements" — graded on the terminal outcome. | Task field; schema in `devops_bench/tasks/schema.py` |
| **Registry** | A generic name-to-object lookup with entry-point plugin discovery. It backs every extension axis: `AGENTS`, `MODELS`, `PROVIDERS`, `FAULTS`, `TRIGGERS`, `VERIFIERS`, `METRICS`. | `devops_bench/core/registry.py` |
| **Bastion** | An alternate execution environment — a VM that runs the harness in-VPC. | See [bastion.md](./bastion.md) |

### Chaos

The planned-disruption subsystem (`devops_bench/chaos/`) that stresses the cluster while the agent works.

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **ChaosSpec** | The disruption definition on a task: pairs a trigger, an action/fault, and a `verify` reference. |
| **Trigger** | Decides *when* a fault fires (e.g. a time delay). |
| **Fault** | The disruptive action itself (e.g. generate load against a service). |
| **ChaosAgent** | An LLM tool-loop that drives the fault's commands. |

### Verification

Type-safe assertions about cluster state (`devops_bench/verification/`).

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **VerificationSpec** | The assertion tree on a task, referenced by a chaos spec's `verify`. |
| **Compound nodes** | `sequence` and `parallel` nodes that combine other verifiers. |
| **Verifier** | A leaf check against live cluster state (e.g. `pod_healthy`, `scaling_complete`), evaluated against one shared deadline. |

### Run state

Per-run plumbing in `devops_bench/core/`.

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **RunContext** | Per-task state threaded through a run. |
| **ClusterInfo** | Cluster connection details (name, location, kubeconfig). |
| **RunEnv** | Per-run isolation (kubeconfig, gcloud config, tofu data dir, unique cluster name) that lets concurrent runs share a host without colliding. |
