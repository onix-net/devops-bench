    Base name for the stack. The two regional GKE clusters are named

    name-truncation window (see locals in main.tf). The global LB / Cloud SQL
    resources derive their names from it too. Supplied by the harness
    (GKE_CLUSTER_NAME); the "cluster_name" output returns the east cluster so the
    harness credentials it.
