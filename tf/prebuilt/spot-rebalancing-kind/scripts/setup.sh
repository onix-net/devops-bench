# Setup for the spot-rebalancing task. Runs from OUTSIDE the cluster during
# `tofu apply`, before the agent starts:
#   1. designates node pools on the multi-node kind cluster: one worker stays
#      "on-demand" (untainted); the rest become "spot" — labeled
#      'cloud.google.com/gke-spot=true' (the real GKE Spot label) and tainted
#      'cloud.google.com/gke-spot=true:NoSchedule' so only Spot-tolerant pods
#      land there, mirroring a reserved Spot node pool,
#   2. deploys the workload fleet (a mix of critical/stateful and
#      fault-tolerant/batch services). Because the Spot nodes are tainted and no
#      workload tolerates them yet, everything starts on the on-demand node — the
#      costly "before" state the agent must optimize,
#   3. waits for the fleet to become Available so the agent starts healthy.
#
# The node taints/labels need kubectl (the kind provider can't express per-node
# taints declaratively); the rightsizing report is delivered declaratively by a
# local_file resource in main.tf, not here.
#
# Nothing here tells the agent which workloads to move — it must read each
# workload's metadata (labels/annotations) and the report and decide itself.
